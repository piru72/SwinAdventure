## 6. Locations


- identifiable and have a name, and description.
- Can contain items.
- Players have a location.
    - Players "locate" items by checking three things (in order):
    - First checking if they are what is to be located (locate "inventory")
    - Second, checking if they have what is being located ( _inventory fetch "gem")
    - Lastly, checking if the item can be located where they are ( _location, locate "gem")
- This will change the look command to also include "look" to look at the player's location.
