## 4. Looking Command

As there will be a number of Commands, an abstract Command class has also been added.

- This class inherits from Identifiable Object, as each of the commands needs to be identifiable. 
- When data is entered by the user, each Command object will be asked “Are You” and the 
first work of the command.

- For example, with “look at pen” each Command would be asked 
“Are You ‘look’ ” to locate the Command to process the text. As a result the Look Command 
should be identified by “look”.

The details plan for this step can by found in the iteration 4 plan.
